load google map and draw a path between two points (using react native )
i used a react web page
React Native for Web is intended to let you write a single app that runs in a browser using standard web technologies.
dependencies tha i used:
  npm install --save firebase,
  npm install --save react-router-dom,
  npm install --save react-bootstarp,
  npm install --save google-maps-react,
 
before you run this project go to ..../test/ and install node module,

there are two pages:
  1, login page:
    just to know, how to authenticate between Firebase and React.
    and wen you must signup before login (just username: example@gmail.com, password: *********, whatever you want)
  2, the main page that loads google map (Home.js)
